## HI There
This project is a simple Todo Application where-
-People can create a todo
-Anyone can see there existing Todo
-Anyone can mark there completed Todo

//Initalize a node project
//put a package.json we never send someone node modules just send them package.json and when they write npm install everything including dependecies in package,json gets installed

-After putting an empty express app
-express.json to make sure post end points will work and parse the body if its json body
-post end point to add a todo
-todos end point to get all the existing todos
-completed end point to get all the completed todos
